GIPHY
This app allows you to control animated gifs (start/stop animation).
First select a show, and it will select the most popular gifs with that show from the GIPHY website.
You can add new shows of your own. If no results are returned, then your Show will not be entered. But if there are, then a button with that show will be added.
Each gif can be animated by clicking on the picture. They will stop if you click on them a 2nd time.
Have fun!
